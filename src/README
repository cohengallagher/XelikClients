# A Xelik Clients
## A Cohen Gallagher - 3/7/2025

This project is for a midterm assignment in my java class. It was designed to represent
a database that stores clients for a business along with their contact information.

My brother owns an online coaching business. This java program is designed to showcase
what a GUI would look like for him to insert clients into a database. I always told him
I would eventually use my skills in IT to help him with his business.
